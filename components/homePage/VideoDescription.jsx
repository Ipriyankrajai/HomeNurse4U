          Decentralization is an effective way to make clinical trials more
          patient-focused, providing numerous advantages for sponsors,
          clinicians, and most importantly, patients.
        </p>
        <p className="bt mt-[15px] text-[#64726F]">
          By introducing decentralized components, such as home healthcare
          services, into clinical trials, clinical researchers can create a more
          efficient, streamlined process for all stakeholders involved. Not only
          does this offer a more personalized experience for patients, but it
          also ultimately allows for better-quality results from clinical
          trials.
